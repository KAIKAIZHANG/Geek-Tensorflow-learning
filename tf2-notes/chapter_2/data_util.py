    """Loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

  This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories,
  along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as
  a drop-in replacement for MNIST. The class labels are:

  | Label | Description |
  |:-----:|-------------|
  |   0   | T-shirt/top |
  |   1   | Trouser     |
  |   2   | Pullover    |
  |   3   | Dress       |
  |   4   | Coat        |
  |   5   | Sandal      |
  |   6   | Shirt       |
  |   7   | Sneaker     |
  |   8   | Bag         |
  |   9   | Ankle boot  |

  Returns:
      Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.

      **x_train, x_test**: uint8 arrays of grayscale image data with shape
        (num_samples, 28, 28).

      **y_train, y_test**: uint8 arrays of labels (integers in range 0-9)
        with shape (num_samples,).
